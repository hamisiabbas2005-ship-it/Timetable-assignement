# 2024/2025 School Timetable

## Project Description

This project recreates the 2024/2025 academic year school timetable using HTML and CSS. The timetable is implemented as a fixed layout table, centered on the page, with merged cells for breaks, lunch, and combined periods. The design uses semantic HTML elements such as `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` to ensure a logical and accessible structure.

## Accessibility Considerations

- Table headers use `<th>` elements with appropriate `scope` attributes (`scope="col"` for column headers and `scope="row"` for row headers) to improve screen reader compatibility.
- The timetable uses semantic HTML elements (`<thead>`, `<tbody>`) to separate header and content sections.
- Break and lunch periods are visually distinguished with background colors and bold text for easy identification.
- The timetable preview image (`timetable_preview.png`) includes descriptive alt text to assist users relying on screen readers.
